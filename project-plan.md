#Find Me A Coffee

## Project Plan

### Mission: Should you decide to accept it
Find a way to let the people know the coffee shops in their area.  Preferably mobile site.

## Features:
1. Google Map featuring API data
2. Works on mobile devices
1. Postcode search, to change API request
2. Selector for specific chains, to change API request
1. Add coffee shop or point of interest
2. Populate map with Yelp and localhost API data.
1. Create user account
1. Login
2. Store custom points of interest for each user.

## Growth Opportunties:
1. Can the Yelp API do postcode searches for coffee shops.  Might have to use multiple API calls to Yelp for different branches of coffee shops or generally different search criteria.  This would be to refine the search.
2. Find good mobile CSS framework
